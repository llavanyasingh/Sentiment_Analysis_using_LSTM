# Sentiment_Analysis_using_LSTM

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with identifying and classifying the sentiment polarity of textual data. With the rapid growth of e-commerce and social media, automated systems that can analyze sentiments from product reviews, feedback, and posts have become crucial for businesses.
Techniques for sentiment analysis have evolved from rule-based approaches and bag-of-words models to deep learning architectures that leverage distributed word embeddings and sequential modeling. Traditional machine learning methods such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) often fail to capture sequential dependencies in natural language. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have emerged as state-of-the-art approaches for sentiment classification due to their ability to model long-term dependencies.
